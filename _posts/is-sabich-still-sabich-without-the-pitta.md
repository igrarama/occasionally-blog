One of the hottest subjects in my country is the validity and importance of our educational system. While no one says we should not have one (or at least I hope no one does) everyone has their own idea about how it should act.

What is the most important subject? Math? Hebrew?
What is the place for theology in our school systems?
Should children learn theoretical subjects or practical ones?
Prepare them for life? jobs? university?

Next to these questions and many others, my opinion means nothing. At least now, I do hope to change it someday. But this is my site, and thus I have a platform to give my opinion wether someone asks for it or not. I believe the subject matter does not really matter. Yes, it is great to know mathematics and how to speak correctly. While I'm not religius I do see the value in teaching theolegy. I would argue more resources should be given to the arts. Philosophy would probably be my first recommendation if someone asked me what the carriculam should be.

But to me, that is all meaningless unless children learn how to deliver ideas across the room. Language is beautiful and its basic usage is that of delivering ideas. As better writers than me once said: "Give me rock". Over the past six years I have worked with many people between the ages of 18 and 30. I believe the rate of success they had in their jobs largely depended on their abillity to deliver their thoughts in a coherent manner.

As I said, I do not believe the subject matter is important. However, no matter how good of a thinker one might be, it is meaningless if no one is willing to listen to you. And the only way to make them listen is by delivering giving your thoughts and ideas room to breath with words.

When I last wrote a post, 179 days ago, I said I wanted to write more. Well, that didn't happen. Mostly because I was lazy, but I could give other reasons that no one, including myself, cares about. English is not my mother tounge and thus writing here helps me practice it. I'm not that bad at using it (if I may say so myself) but I am rusty. I can feel it while writing this post. From grammar mistakes to words that escape my mind it is all a bit... much...

I enjoy it though. I enjoy it because I like a challenge and because I know the benefit it might give me in the future. I also enjoy it because I feel true to my words. Writing about one's abillity to express oneself while doing it this badly is embarassing to say the least. Hopefully, this time I might do a better job at keeping at it.
