Names are important. Seems obvious though I only really thought about it after one of my favorite authors, Patrick Rothfuss, wrote it in a book. Having that thought in mind one must look for an appropriate name whenever one wishes to make something important.

Probably not my best writing but I guess it is a start. I used to write more and I wish I would come back to it. This is why I came here. This is why I've decided to be an average tech nerd and create a blog for myself. I don't plan to commit to anything besides my idea of writing. It could be about anything and whenever I want it to be.

With that thought I set out to look for a name. So with no particular topic in my mind the only thing I can say to introduce myself is that I occasionally blog.

Good luck to us all.
